                 <p>
                    As a child i was always fascinated by logical problems.
                    I played lots of chess and strategie games and math was the only subject at school 
                    that i was honestly interested in. 
                    Unfortunately during school i never came in touch with coding. This happened only while i was already studying statsics.
                    I was immediately fascinated by the possibilties and logical challenges coding provides.
                    At that time i have been working for T端v S端d as a working student. I had to transform very big excel sheets and 
                    had therefore a very practical use for my new (very little) knowledge. Fortunately my superior recognized my interest and gave me 
                    the chance to work in a web development team. I finsihed my studies but decided to work as a developper. <br />
                    The feeling to create something in a structured and maintainable way satisfies me more than the work as a statistican. <br />

                     -Chess- <br />
                     Chess is my favourite game as it is purely logical and there is no luck included at all.
                     I admire chess pros for their ability to calculate through hundreds of possibilities and to memorize thousands of played positions and the corresponding evaluations.

                     As teenager i skated everyday for about 2 years. Some injuries later i stopped and 
                     restarted a year ago but with more focus on the movement rather than on (some times) dangerous tricks.
